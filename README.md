# SURF
Boosted Sparse and Low-Rank Tensor Regression

arXiv download: https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01158

We have included detailed comments of the code. You can first generate the simulation data by the code, and then run our SURF algorithm for both training and testing.

The code is written for MATLAB with the Tensorlab toolbox. We will release a python implementation soon.
